This release features the result of our tablet-first initiative, a new theme called Tableau that uses magazine-like styling combined with gesture-based navigation and responsive layouts to resemble native apps for mobile devices.</p>
<p>Chronicle supports a built-in staging and deployment workflow to quickly get the right content, to the right place, at the right time. Your web team will no longer have to rely on error-prone web publishing tools and time-consuming staging and deployment processes. Using Perforce's Enterprise Version Management technology as its foundation, only a click is required to create new staging and development environments with Perforce Chronicle. With this built-in workflow, taking new content live has never been so simple regardless of the number of users or amount and type of content you are managing.</p>
<p>Chronicle gives you the creativity you want and the control you need. It combines an easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor with enterprise-class version management. You can create your own themes and content types, and can extend the product by creating modules and widgets. Chronicle is highly customizable, and we have taken great care to ensure that web developers will be able to do amazing things with it.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about how to manage Chronicle, login, then explore the Administrator's Guide under the Help link. Here you can find more information on things like managing users, creating and managing new content types, or managing roles and permissions.</p>
<p>Customization and extension of a CMS is a key component for advanced use. Documentation on how to create and work with themes as well as extending the product through custom modules is available in the Developer's Guide under the help link.</p>
<p>Learn more about the Tableau theme features including changes to the toolbar, editing, and social integration in the Getting Started chapter of the documentation. This documentation also includes information about the Image Rotator widget used on the Tableau theme's cover page.</p>"
