    <para>
        Comments are an optional &product.longname; feature that allows your web site's audience
        to provide feedback for the content they see. You can choose to:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            allow or disallow comments individually for any content entry
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            require users to be logged in to comment
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            display or hide comments when the associated content entry is viewed
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            hide comments unless they are approved, or the user is authenticated
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            allow voting on comments
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            restrict voting to once per user per content entry, if voting is allowed
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
        Authenticated users automatically have their userid associated with their comments.
        Unauthenticated users need to provide a name and optionally an email address, as well as
        successfully satisfy a <acronym>CAPTCHA</acronym> to prevent automated commenting. For both
        types of users, if their email address is registered at
        <ulink url="http://gravatar.com/">gravatar.com</ulink>, their custom
        <emphasis>avatar</emphasis> graphic is displayed alongside their comment.
