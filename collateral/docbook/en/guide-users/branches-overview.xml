    <para>
        A branch is a copy of all of your web site's configuration, content, categories, menus, etc.
        Initially, &product.longname; installs a <emphasis>Live</emphasis> branch, which your users
        see when they visit your site. When a new branch is created, it is initially identical to
        the <emphasis>source</emphasis> branch it was branched from. You can then make changes in
        the new branch to some or all of your content without exposing your work in progress to your
        users. When you are ready, you can pull your changes into the source branch.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can use branches for small tasks, such as fixing typos, or larger tasks such as updating
        many content entries at once, or even wholesale restructuring of your content. Branches can
        be hierarchical. You might create a branch for the task of rolling out a new
        product line, and then create several child branches dedicated to specific content areas
        such as product descriptions, press releases, and support.
    </para>

    <note>
        <title>The Live Branch is Special</title>

        <para>
            The Live branch's configuration can be edited, but it cannot have a parent branch, and
            it cannot be deleted.
