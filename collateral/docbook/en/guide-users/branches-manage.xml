                        When there are many more sites and branches than fits on-screen, only enough
                        entries are retrieved to fill the display. When you use the scrollbar,
                        additional entries are fetched. This means that scrolling might appear to be
                        slightly slower than you might expect, but it allows filtering, sorting and
                        initial display to be much faster when you have hundreds or thousands of
                        sites or branches.

        <title>Determining the Active Branch</title>

        <para>
            The name of active branch appears at the left end of the management toolbar, and within
            the datagrid the active branch is denoted with "(active)". In the screenshot above, this
            is "Live".
