    <title>Internet Explorer CSS Limitations</title>

    <para>
        Internet Explorer (<acronym>IE</acronym>) has a limitation of directly loading up to
        31 <acronym>CSS</acronym> stylesheets. As &product.name; has many optional modules and
        themes, each with their own styles, it is very easy to reach or exceed this limitation.
        When this occurs, any additional stylesheets are not loaded and the styling of your
        site is likely incorrect. Please see
        <ulink url="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/05/14/10164546.aspx">Eric
        Law's IEInternals blog posting</ulink> for more details.
    </para>

    <para>
        To mitigate this limitation, &product.name; automatically aggregates or consolidates
        stylesheets for production or development modes respectively. In production mode, all
        stylesheets are aggregated into a single stylesheet to minimize the web requests and
        improve cache behaviour. In development mode, stylesheets are consolidated into style
        blocks that use the <command>@import</command> <acronym>CSS</acronym> rule when the
        site is accessed via Internet Explorer. Microsoft allows up to 31 such style blocks that
        can each include up to 31 <command>@import</command> rules.
