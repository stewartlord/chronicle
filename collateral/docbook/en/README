Perforce Chronicle Docbook Documentation README
=====================================================================

Required software:

- autoconf
- make
- xsltproc
- xmllint

Optional software, for PDF generation:
- fop

On Windows, you should use Cygwin software or another port of GNU 
development tools.


How to 'build' the HTML version of the DocBook documentation:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- run "autoconf" in this dir
- run "./configure" in this dir
- run "make"

The HTML files are rendered in the "../../../docs/manual" dir.

When developing content, you can verify your changes by running:

  "make check"

This verifies the XML for the whole manual is valid.

You can verify your changes in a single file by running:

  "make XMLFILE=filename.xml check1"

The filename.xml is relative to the "module_specs" directory.


How to 'build' the PDF version of the DocBook documentation:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- run "autoconf" in this dir, if not already run for HTML docs.
- run "./configure" in this dir, if not already run.
- run "make pdf"

The PDF files are rendered in the "../../../docs/pdf" dir.

To generate PDF versions of the documentation, you must install FOP:
    http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/download.html

Once installed, make sure the FOP binary is in your $PATH. As FOP is
a Java program, JAVA_HOME must be set to wherever your (JDK or JRE)
happens to be installed.

For Windows XP, the standard install requires:
   JAVA_HOME='c:\Program Files\Java\jre6'


How to 'build' a CHM project file
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To generate a CHM project file, you must install MsHtmlHelpWorkshop.

To build the CHM file on the command line navigate to the directory
in which the manual html files are built as described above

Then call:

 "C:/path/to/workshop/hhc htmlhelp.hhp"

where "C:/path/to/workshop/" is the path to MsHtmlHelpWorkshop.

This will build a "Chronicle_LANGUAGE.chm" file.

 You should now have an index in the file..
