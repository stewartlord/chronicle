    <title>Managing Permissions</title>

    <para>
        Permissions are the association of <emphasis>privileges</emphasis>, which are actions that
        are provided by <emphasis>resources</emphasis> such as a &product.longname; module, to
        <emphasis>roles</emphasis>. For example, you may want to give users having the
        <emphasis>member</emphasis> role the privileges to add new categories and associate them
        with content, but not give them the privilege of managing categories. There are many
        privileges provided by &product.name; and each activated module can implement its own
        resources and privileges.
    </para>

    <para>
        The <emphasis role="screen">Manage Permissions</emphasis> screen is where management of
        privilege and role associations are performed. Privileges are listed vertically in the
        first column, roles are listed horizontally, representing the grid of possible permission
        associations. Hover your mouse over each of the numbered callouts to highlight the
        associated area of the screen.

                        Resources are groups of privileges, typically provided by a &product.name;
                        module. Clicking on the checkboxes in these rows toggles all of the
                        resource's privileges on or off.
