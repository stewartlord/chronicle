        &product.longname; provides a report called System Information that presents all the
        operating parameters that could influence, or be influenced by, &product.name;'s operation.
        This includes the configured sites, all of the installed modules and themes, including
        runtime information from <acronym>PHP</acronym>, the Perforce server, and the Apache web
        server. Entries describing &product.name; components include checksum comparisons to help
        you identify whether anything within the release has been modified.

            libraries <classname>P4</classname>, <classname>Phly</classname>, and
            <classname>Zend</classname> match their original distribution checksums. The checksum
            checks can take some time, so you may see a progress graphic for any entries waiting
            on the result the validation process.

            to combine all the information into a single file, which is ideal for attaching to any
            support requests you may have.
