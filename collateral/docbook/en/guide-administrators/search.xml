        &product.longname; ships with a Search module powered by
        <ulink url="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.html">Zend Search
        Lucene</ulink>. &product.name; ships with reasonable defaults for indexing operations,
        but you may need to adjust the configuration to suit your deployment. Also, you may need
        to optimize or rebuild the search indexes.

    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            Choose <command>Manage > Modules</command>. The <emphasis role="screen">Manage
            Modules</emphasis> screen is displayed, listing available modules.
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            Find the Search module in the list of modules, either by scrolling or typing
            <emphasis>search</emphasis> into the Search field.
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            Click the Search module's <guibutton>Configure</guibutton> button. The
            <emphasis role="dialog">Search Configuration</emphasis> dialog is displayed:

            </mediaobject>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            Enter settings for:

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <emphasis role="bold">Buffer Limit</emphasis>: the maximum number of documents
                    that to be kept in-memory while indexing is performed. This value can be
                    increased if your content is primarily smaller entries or sufficient memory is
                    available, or reduced if your content includes large file content, such as
                    entries of many megabytes, or if memory availability is limited.
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <emphasis role="bold">Merge Limit</emphasis>: the maximum number of documents
                    considered when index segments are merged. Smaller values (less than 10,000) are
                    best for interactive indexing, as this limits the length of pauses while
                    indexing to a few seconds. Larger values are best for batched indexing and
                    speedier searches.
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <emphasis role="bold">Merge Factor</emphasis>: determines how index segments are
                    merged when new documents are indexed. With smaller values, less memory is used
                    while indexing, and searches on unoptimized indices are faster, but indexing
                    speed is slower. With larger values, more memory is used during indexing, and
                    while searches on unoptimized indices are slower, indexing is faster. Thus
                    larger values (&gt; 10) are best for batch index creation, and smaller values
                    (&lt; 10) for indices that are interactively maintained.

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            Click the <guibutton>Optimize</guibutton> button to optimize the search index. This may
            be necessary after many new documents have been added or removed.
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            Click the <guibutton>Rebuild</guibutton> button to rebuild the search index from
            existing data. This may be necessary if the indexer ever runs out of memory, or if a
            search engine gets corrupted in some other way.
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            Click <guibutton>Save</guibutton>. Your Search configuration is saved.
