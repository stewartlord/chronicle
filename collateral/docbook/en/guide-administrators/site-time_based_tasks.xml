    <title>Time-Based Tasks</title>

    <para>
        The <classname>Cron</classname> module provides infrastructure for executing periodic,
        time-based tasks within &product.longname;. In addition to built-in time-based tasks, such
        as scheduling workflow transitions (see <xref linkend="workflows.scheduled.transitions"/>),
        developers may subscribe to one or more periodic <acronym>pub/sub</acronym> topics to
        execute their own tasks. The topic template is
        <code>p4cms.cron.<replaceable>frequency</replaceable></code>, where
        <replaceable>frequency</replaceable> is one of <emphasis role="bold">hourly</emphasis>,
        <emphasis role="bold">daily</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">weekly</emphasis>, or
        <emphasis role="bold">monthly</emphasis>. Please see
        <xref linkend="modules.integration.pubsub"/> for additional topic details.
    </para>

    <para>
        The <classname>Cron</classname> module only guarantees that topics described above are not
        published too often. For example, the <code>p4cms.cron.hourly</code> is executed, at most,
        once per hour. By itself, &product.name; cannot guarantee topic publication at appropriate
        times because it normally only executes when fielding a request, and only for long enough to
        provide a response. To ensure that topics are published regularly and often enough, a
        request to the <classname>Cron</classname> module must be made at least once per hour.
        Unix-like systems can use a <emphasis>cron</emphasis> job to make this happen.
        Alternatively, you can use the optional <classname>Easy Cron</classname> module
        provided with &product.name; (see <link linkend="site.time-based-tasks.easy">below</link>).
    </para>

    <section id="site.time-based-tasks.cronjob">
        <title>Setting Up a Cron Job</title>

        <para>
            On a UNIX-compatible system, the following line needs to be added to the system
            <code>crontab</code> file (its usual path is <code>/etc/crontab</code>, but may be
            located elsewhere depending on the distribution you use):

<programlisting language="text">
  0 * * * *     wget -O - -q -t 1 http://<replaceable>example.com</replaceable>/cron
</programlisting>

            where <replaceable>http://example.com</replaceable> needs to be replaced by your
            site <acronym>URL</acronym>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The above line executes the <filename>wget</filename> utility at the top of each hour,
            making a web request to the <classname>Cron</classname> each time.
        </para>

        <para>
            The "<option>-O -</option>" options tell <filename>wget</filename> to write its output
            to standard out, "<option>-q</option>" runs quietly and "<option>-t 1</option>" limits
            the number of retries to one. If you do not have <filename>wget</filename>, try
            <filename>curl</filename> with comparable options.
        </para>

        <para>
            The response to cron requests is a <acronym>JSON</acronym> encoded report for each
            topic:
        </para>

<programlisting language="javascript">
  {"hourly":"executed","daily":"failed","weekly":"skipped","monthly":"skipped"}
</programlisting>

        <para>
            The example report above says that:

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <code>p4cms.cron.hourly</code> topic was successfully published
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    there were errors during publishing <code>p4cms.cron.daily</code> topic
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <code>p4cms.cron.weekly</code> topic was not published (i.e. previously
                    executed)
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <code>p4cms.cron.monthly</code> topic was not published (i.e. previously
                    executed)
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

    <section id="site.time-based-tasks.easy">
        <title>Easy Cron</title>

        <para>
            <classname>Easy Cron</classname> is an optional module shipped with &product.name;.
            When this module is enabled, a small piece of javascript is added to each page to
            send an <acronym>AJAX</acronym> request to
            <code><replaceable>site-url</replaceable>/cron</code>. No additional system-level
            privileges or services are required. Please see
            <xref linkend="modules.management.enable-disable"/> for further details.
        </para>

        <para>
            Users should not notice any kind of delay or disruption when viewing the site.
            However, it does have a performance impact as every page view causes one additional
            request to the <classname>Cron</classname> module; for busy sites, the
            <classname>Easy Cron</classname> module should be disabled and the
            <emphasis>cron job</emphasis> approach described 
            <link linkend="site.time-based-tasks.cronjob">above</link> should be followed.
        </para>

        <warning>
            <para>
                If you use <classname>Easy Cron</classname>, be aware that <emphasis role="bold">no
                time-based tasks are executed until a request to your site is made</emphasis>.
                Pending tasks are only be executed once a request is made.
