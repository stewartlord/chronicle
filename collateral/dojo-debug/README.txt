This is a custom release build of the dojo toolkit that is not concatenated or compressed. 
The advantage of using this resource over the source directly is that the localization resources have been generated.
This build was created using the following command from the dojo source:

./build.sh profile=standard optimize=none layerOptimize=none copyTests=false action=release
